-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   To create a modern look and feel against the background images grays and whites were used.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Lato is the main font used on the site with Oswald used for the headings (h2). Sans Serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lato and Oswald fonts work well together. They are professional and readable fonts that still have charm and character.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The background images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention.

    ### Initial Coding
    -   The site was originally coded in Replit alongside the "Love Running" project and therefore takes a lot of the features and source code from this resource.

    ### Responsiveness
    -   Each of the pages were also checked on ui.dev/amiresponsive, see the screenshots below:

        2. As the user scrolls down there's an ethos section communicating the benefits of regular dog grooming, a map indicating the area covered by the mobile service and finally a footer with social media links.
        3. The main points are made immediately with the hero image and ethos section.
        4. The user has several choices to learn more about the organisation. They can click on a navigation bar menu option to access a page to "Contact" the business, view "Prices" or a "Gallery" of photos and testimonials.

Once the "Contact Us" button is clicked the user input is checked for valid entries where required and the user prompted if there is a problem.
