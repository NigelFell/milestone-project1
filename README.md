-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   To create a modern look and feel against the background images grays and whites were used.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Lato is the main font used on the site with Oswald used for the headings (h2). Sans Serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lato and Oswald fonts work well together. They are professional and readable fonts that still have charm and character.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The background images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention.
